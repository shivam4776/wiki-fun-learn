## 🤖 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. User inputs a topic (e.g., "String Theory").
2. Bot fetches summary or full text from Wikipedia.
3. LLM rewrites it with:

   * Simpler vocabulary
   * Clearer structure
   * A bit of fun and personality
4. Output is returned in a chat-style interface.

* 🎮 Gamified quizzes based on the explained topic
* 🧍 Different personas (e.g., teacher, comedian, pirate 🏴‍☠️)
